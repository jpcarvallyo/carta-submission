# Carta Submission

## Introduction

Hello, my name is James Carvallyo. This is my submission for the technical take home exercise.

[Recorded Demo ](https://www.loom.com/share/b4bdcbe5dfb44ce08e91e5de6db7defd?sid=2552677f-0b9a-452e-abc3-955143ed36f1)

## Ways to get started

Run the `yarn add` command to install the node_modules
Run the `yarn start` command to run the project

## Requirements

- DO fetch the directory tree from the mock backend (see src/api.js). See API details below.
- DO display all files in the project, with files nested inside of folders as needed.
- DO allow folders to be collapsed and expanded.
- DO display the appropriate icon next to each file. There is a "default file" icon you can use as a fallback for unknown file types.
- DO display a "delete" button when hovering over a file or folder. Clicking on the delete button should delete the file or folder. You must persist changes to the mock backend using the removeById(id) API wrapper. See API details below.

- DO match the provided mocks as closely as possible, time permitting. See detailed mocks below.
- DO prioritize functionality over visual fidelity.
- You MAY add unit or integration tests as needed, but we do not expect you to provide test coverage.
- You MAY use lodash or similar pure-JS utility libraries
- You MAY use CSS, SASS, or styled-components for styling
- You MAY use TypeScript

DO NOT rely on third-party hook libraries. We want to see how you write React code and manage state!
